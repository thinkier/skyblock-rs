# skyblock-rs
Rust client for interacting with Hypixel's Skyblock API

## Getting started
`examples/index` is a fairly simple example of how to index into all of the current available auctions, other features will be added as I go along. This library is written using stable rust's futures! So minimum rustc of `1.39` or it won't run. Consult the examples' `Cargo.toml` if in doubt.
